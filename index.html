                <h1>
                    Tasker (Paid)
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Tasker is The most powerfull android automation tool which can be used by the most useless to actual
                    devs to test apis
                    or prototype certain behavior or just to even prank people if ur still in 2012
                    <br>
                    - Tasker has the power to export the automation profiles as seperate apps and install them on phones
                    as stand alone
                    apps.
                    these apps can be published on playstore, but its really better not to.
                    <br>
                    I recommend buying the app from gplay instead of getting a cracked version as this supports its
                    development.
                    The recent Tasker have given it more power than ever and with endless potential.
                    <br>
                    - install it <a

                <p>
                    If ur a javaScript dev you can write scripts that perform android actions using JavaScript.
                    but async/await cant be used with the Tasker JavaScript functions.
